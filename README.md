A basic news site. Features a page that displays the top 5 US News headlines provided by www.newsapi.org, a second page which searches newsapi's "everything" endpoint and displays
the top 5 results from any search string, and finally a simple weather page using the www.weatherbit.io 16-day forecast API, truncated to a single week of results for a given
zip code.

Requires npm to install dependencies. Navigate to the folder in the console and "npm start" to run the app.
